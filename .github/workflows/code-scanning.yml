# Scan the code using CodeQL whenever new commits are pushed to the main branch
# or whenever any activity happens inside a pull request targeting the main
# branch. This workflow will only be executed if at least one modified file
# resides outside the "docs" subdirectory and is not directly under the
# repository's root directory.
